# Auto-repair country names to their closest known match

The "act on it" companion to
[`check_country_match()`](https://pursuitofdatascience.github.io/countryatlas/reference/check_country_match.md):
replaces unmatched country names with their closest known country name
(by string distance), but only when the match is confident enough, and
reports what it changed. Pipe the result into
[`standardize_country()`](https://pursuitofdatascience.github.io/countryatlas/reference/standardize_country.md)
/
[`join_world()`](https://pursuitofdatascience.github.io/countryatlas/reference/join_world.md).

## Usage

``` r
repair_country_names(
  x,
  threshold = 0.2,
  origin = "country.name",
  verbose = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A vector of country names.

- threshold:

  Maximum string distance to accept a repair (0 = identical, 1 =
  unrelated). Lower is stricter; default `0.2`. Uses Jaro-Winkler when
  `stringdist` is installed, otherwise a length-normalised edit
  distance.

- origin:

  countrycode origin scheme (default `"country.name"`).

- verbose:

  Whether to message the substitutions made (default `TRUE`).

## Value

A character vector the same length as `x`, with confident misses
replaced by the closest known country name (others left unchanged). The
applied substitutions are attached as the attribute `"repairs"`.

## Examples

``` r
repair_country_names(c("United States", "Brzil", "Germny"))
#> ✔ Repaired 2 country names:
#> • "Brzil -> Brazil" and "Germny -> Germany"
#> [1] "United States" "Brazil"        "Germany"      
#> attr(,"repairs")
#> # A tibble: 2 × 2
#>   from   to     
#>   <chr>  <chr>  
#> 1 Brzil  Brazil 
#> 2 Germny Germany
```
