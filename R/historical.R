# Historical / dissolved entities ------------------------------------------------

# Alias -> canonical historical-entity name, shared by dissolve_country() and
# check_country_match(). Lowercased, whitespace-squished exact matches; kept
# deliberately small and unambiguous ("Sudan" alone is NOT here -- it is a
# current country -- only the explicitly historical spellings are).

#' Resolve dissolved entities to their successor states
#'
#' Historical data is full of countries that no longer exist -- the USSR,
#' Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia -- and they poison naive joins twice over: most
#' are silently unmatched, and some are silently *mis*matched
#' (`countrycode` resolves `"USSR"` to Russia alone, so Soviet-era totals
#' quietly become Russian totals). `dissolve_country()` resolves a mixed
#' vector of historical and modern names against the curated
#' [historical_codes] crosswalk: dissolved entities expand to one row per
#' successor state (one-to-many, dated), while modern names pass through as
#' single rows -- so a whole messy column can be piped in unchanged.
#'
#' @param x A character vector of country names (historical and/or modern).
#' @param warn Whether to warn about names that match neither a historical
#'   entity nor a modern country (default `TRUE`).
#'
#' @return A tibble with one row per (input, successor) pair: `input` (as
#'   given), `historical` (canonical dissolved-entity name, `NA` for modern
#'   countries), `dissolved` (year the entity ceased to exist, `NA` for
#'   modern), `iso3c` and `country` (the successor state). Unmatched inputs
#'   yield one row with `iso3c = NA`.
#' @export
#' @seealso [historical_codes] for the crosswalk itself and the successor
#'   policy (e.g. Kosovo's inclusion in the Yugoslavia list);
#'   [check_country_match()], whose `historical` column flags these entities.
#' @examples
#' dissolve_country(c("USSR", "Czechoslovakia", "France"))
#' # One-to-many: Yugoslavia expands to its successor territories
#' dissolve_country("Yugoslavia")
