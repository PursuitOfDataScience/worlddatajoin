# Resolve dissolved entities to their successor states

Historical data is full of countries that no longer exist – the USSR,
Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia – and they poison naive joins twice over:
most are silently unmatched, and some are silently *mis*matched
(`countrycode` resolves `"USSR"` to Russia alone, so Soviet-era totals
quietly become Russian totals). `dissolve_country()` resolves a mixed
vector of historical and modern names against the curated
[historical_codes](https://pursuitofdatascience.github.io/countryatlas/reference/historical_codes.md)
crosswalk: dissolved entities expand to one row per successor state
(one-to-many, dated), while modern names pass through as single rows –
so a whole messy column can be piped in unchanged.

## Usage

``` r
dissolve_country(x, warn = TRUE)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A character vector of country names (historical and/or modern).

- warn:

  Whether to warn about names that match neither a historical entity nor
  a modern country (default `TRUE`).

## Value

A tibble with one row per (input, successor) pair: `input` (as given),
`historical` (canonical dissolved-entity name, `NA` for modern
countries), `dissolved` (year the entity ceased to exist, `NA` for
modern), `iso3c` and `country` (the successor state). Unmatched inputs
yield one row with `iso3c = NA`.

for the crosswalk itself and the successor policy (e.g. Kosovo's
inclusion in the Yugoslavia list);
[`check_country_match()`](https://pursuitofdatascience.github.io/countryatlas/reference/check_country_match.md),
whose `historical` column flags these entities.
