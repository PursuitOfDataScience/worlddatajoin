# countryatlas 2.0.0

A major release that wires countryatlas into the database-rendering world via
'ggsql', widens the map vocabulary, and fixes several correctness issues found
by auditing 1.0.0. The version is bumped to 2.0.0 because the bug fixes change
the output of `world_map()` (quantile binning), `bubble_map()` / `flow_map()`
(de-duplicated symbols), `geom_country_labels()` (label placement) and
`convert_country()` (override-only entities) — code that depended on the old
behaviour may see different maps or values.

## New: database-side rendering with ggsql

* `as_ggsql_source()` exports a curated, ISO-reconciled, WDI-joined table (with
  `sf` geometry WKB-encoded) as a [ggsql](https://ggsql.org) source — a DuckDB
  connection, a Parquet file, or a nanoarrow stream. countryatlas does the
  reconciliation ggsql's static bundled world can't; ggsql does the database
  push-down and Vega-Lite output countryatlas doesn't.
* `world_query()` emits a `ggsql` spatial query (`VISUALISE … DRAW spatial
  PROJECT TO … SCALE … LABEL …`) — a dependency-free string builder.
* `interactive_map(engine = "ggsql")` registers the data and renders the map in
  DuckDB, returning a Vega-Lite widget.
* `ggsql`, `duckdb`, `DBI` and `nanoarrow` are optional `Suggests`. See the new
  *countryatlas and ggsql* vignette.

## New: maps, projections and helpers

* `globe_map()` — an orthographic globe choropleth, with `backend = "sf"`
  (smoothest limb) or `backend = "polygon"` (needs only `maps` + `mapproj`).
* `spin_globe()` — a rotating-globe animated GIF (one `globe_map()` frame per
  central longitude, assembled with `gifski` or `magick`).
* `facet_map()` — small-multiple choropleths (the static counterpart to
  `animate_world()`).
* `wdj_crs()` gains eight projections (`mercator`, `winkel_tripel`, `eckert4`,
  `gall_peters`, `orthographic`, `azimuthal_equal_area`, `north_polar`,
  `south_polar`); `world_map()` / `world_geometry()` accept them all.
* `locate_country()` — point-in-polygon lookup tagging `lon`/`lat` with `iso3c`.
* `repair_country_names()` — the "act on it" companion to
  `check_country_match()`: auto-applies confident string-distance fixes.
* `country_join_all()` — reduce-join many messy country tables on the ISO spine.
* `growth_rate()`, `index_to()`, `share_of_world()` — panel analysis helpers.
* `country_overrides()` — preferred name for `wdj_overrides()` (kept as an
  alias) after the rename to countryatlas.
* `country_groups_tbl` gains `Mercosur`, `GCC`, `Nordic` and `Visegrad`.
* `country_borders()` — a tidy adjacency edge list built from polygon topology
  (`sf::st_touches()`), with `neighbors()` for a vectorised per-country lookup.
* `distance_between()` — great-circle (haversine) distance between two
  countries' centroids; needs neither `sf` nor the network.
* `dorling_map()` — the Dorling cartogram promoted to a first-class verb, with
  `k`/`itermax` tuning; `cartogram_map()` itself gains `...` passthrough to the
  underlying `cartogram::cartogram_*()` call.

## New: historical entities, inequality and spatial statistics

* `historical_codes` — a curated, dated crosswalk of dissolved entities
  (Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Netherlands
  Antilles, North/South Yemen, pre-2011 Sudan, United Arab Republic,
  Tanganyika/Zanzibar, North/South Vietnam, Serbia and Montenegro) to their
  successor states, with retired ISO codes where they existed. Kosovo is
  included among the Yugoslav successors on a territory basis (documented).
* `dissolve_country()` — resolve a mixed vector of historical *and* modern
  names to successor `iso3c` rows (one-to-many, dated); modern names pass
  through as single rows, so a whole messy column pipes in unchanged.
* `check_country_match()` gains a `historical` column. It flags dissolved
  entities **even when countrycode "matches" them** — the headline case is
  `"USSR"`, which countrycode silently resolves to Russia's `RUS`, so
  Soviet-era data becomes Russian data with no warning.
* `correlate_indicators()` — pairwise indicator correlations on the spine
  (pearson/spearman, pairwise-complete, per-pair `n`), tidy long output.
* `beta_convergence()` / `sigma_convergence()` — the two standard convergence
  diagnostics: the growth-on-initial-level regression (with implied
  convergence speed and half-life) and per-year cross-country dispersion.
* `gini()` and `theil()` — inequality across countries, population-weightable;
  `theil()` decomposes exactly into between/within components when a grouping
  (continent, income) is supplied.
* `lag_by_country()` / `diff_by_country()` — panel lag and difference grouped
  by `iso3c` and ordered by `year`, completing the panel toolkit around
  `growth_rate()` / `index_to()` / `complete_years()`.
* `morans_i()` — global Moran's I with a permutation pseudo-p-value, computed
  on the row-standardised `country_borders()` adjacency. No `spdep`
  dependency: the weights come from the package's own curated topology.
* `spike_map()` — triangular spikes at country centroids (height ∝ value), the
  overplotting-resistant cousin of `bubble_map()`; needs only `maps`.
* `convert_country()` accepts `to = "name_<lang>"` (`"name_fr"`, `"name_es"`,
  `"name_zh"`, …) for localized country names via countrycode's CLDR tables.
* `world_map(style = "binned")` legends now show SI-formatted breaks
  (`4M`, not `4e+06`) when `scales` is installed; the continuous scale uses
  the same formatter.

## Bug fixes

* `world_map(style = "quantile"/"jenks")` computed breaks over polygon
  **vertices**, so a country's geometric complexity biased the quantiles and the
  bins held unequal numbers of countries. Breaks are now computed on one value
  per country.
* `bubble_map(backend = "sf")` placed bubbles in projected metres on a degrees
  base map (off the map). The base map and bubbles now share one projected CRS
  via `coord_sf()`.
* Polygon centroids returned more than one row for ten `iso3c` codes (overrides
  map several names — Azores/Madeira → PRT — to one code), fanning out joins in
  `bubble_map()` / `flow_map()`. Centroids are now one antimeridian-safe row per
  country (the largest piece).
* `geom_country_labels()` placed labels at the bounding-box midpoint over all of
  a country's pieces, so the US / Fiji / NZ labels drifted into the wrong ocean.
  Labels now sit on each country's largest piece.
* `projection = "plate_carree"` built an incoherent PROJ string
  (`+proj=longlat … +units=m`); it is now true equirectangular (`+proj=eqc`).
* `convert_country()` only applied `wdj_overrides()` for `to = "iso3c"`, so
  override-only entities (e.g. "Canary Islands", "Azores", "Bonaire") returned
  `NA` for every other destination (continent, region, iso2c, flag, currency,
  country name, ...). It now resolves the override-corrected `iso3c` first and
  derives every other destination from that.
* Kosovo's `XKX` needed extra care: it has no row at all in
  `countrycode::codelist`, so deriving destinations purely via the `iso3c`
  round-trip above is `NA` for everything — which would have *regressed*
  `flag`/`region`/`country`, since 1.0.0 already resolved those via direct
  name matching (verified against the actual 1.0.0 code). `convert_country()`
  now recovers from the original name when the `iso3c` round-trip comes back
  empty, and fills `iso2c`/`continent` (which neither path classifies) from
  the same curated fallback `standardize_country()` uses. Net effect versus
  1.0.0: zero regressions, plus newly-working `continent`/`iso2c` for Kosovo —
  which also fixes `locate_country(..., add = "continent")` for points inside
  it.
* `interactive_map(..., tooltip = )` was accepted but silently ignored by every
  engine (pre-dating 2.0.0). The `"ggiraph"` and `"leaflet"` engines now use the
  supplied `tooltip` column, defaulting to `fill` as before when omitted.
* `world_data(overrides = )` (and `attach_geometry(overrides = )`) accepted a
  custom name -> iso3c override set but silently ignored it (pre-dating 2.0.0) --
  the geometry backend always matched with the default `wdj_overrides()`. The
  override set now flows through to both the polygon and `sf` matchers, so a
  custom mapping actually changes which polygons a country claims.
* `repair_country_names()` no longer records a no-op "repair" when a dissolved
  entity's own name (e.g. "Yugoslavia", which exists in the codelist but has
  no ISO code) comes back as its closest suggestion; `dissolve_country()` is
  the right tool there and is what the report now points to.

## Housekeeping

* The `gdp_per_capita_2015` compatibility alias (a one-cycle deprecation shim
  from 1.0.0) is now opt-in: set `options(countryatlas.gdp_compat = TRUE)` to
  restore it. The default is `FALSE`, so `world_data()` no longer emits a
  duplicate column.
* `world_snapshot` refreshed to year **2024** (was 2022) and rebuilt with the
  latest WDI data and curated overrides.
* `country_groups_tbl` membership date bumped to 2026-06-01 (was 2024-01-01).
* `?world_snapshot` was out of sync with the rebuilt data (missing the
  "Snapshot year: 2024" note); regenerated.
* Fixed a stray orphaned code fence at the end of the *countryatlas and
  ggsql* vignette that broke its markdown structure.
* README and vignettes now demonstrate every exported function:
  `wdi_search()`, `country_codes()`, `complete_years()`, `growth_rate()` /
  `index_to()`, `repair_country_names()`, `country_join_all()`,
  `locate_country()` and `facet_map()` gained worked examples, and the
  vignettes prefer `country_overrides()` over the soft-deprecated
  `wdj_overrides()`. The README's rendered output and figures were stale
  (pre-dating the quantile-breaks fix and the `gdp_per_capita_2015` opt-in)
  and have been re-rendered from the 2.0.0 code.

# countryatlas 1.0.0

A single, comprehensive release that takes the package from a one-function proof
of concept to a complete toolkit for joining world data to maps. The spirit is
unchanged — *ISO codes as the universal join key, one call to a map-ready
table* — but pushed to its full potential.

## Breaking-ish changes

* `world_data()` is generalised but backward-compatible: `world_data(2020)`
  still returns the classic polygon-backed, GDP-per-capita tibble. The only
  visible change is the column name `gdp_per_capita_2015` → `gdp_per_capita`.
  A one-cycle deprecation shim keeps `gdp_per_capita_2015` available as an alias
  (toggle with `options(countryatlas.gdp_compat = FALSE)`).
* The 16 regions the previous version silently dropped (Kosovo, Micronesia, the
  Virgin Islands, Saint Martin, Bonaire/Saba/Sint Eustatius, the Canary Islands,
  Madeira/Azores, …) are now **matched** via [`wdj_overrides()`] instead of
  deleted, so they appear on maps. Diffs of map output will show increased
  coverage.

## New: core data assembly

* `world_data()` gains `indicator` (one or many WDI codes; named vectors drive
  clean column names), multi-year **panels**, an `sf` backend
  (`geometry = "sf"`), `region` subsetting, `latest`, projections and caching.
* `country_data()` — the lightweight, one-row-per-country analysis table.
* `world_geometry()` — projected, region-subset geometry (countries, centroids,
  coastline, borders, graticule, ocean).

## New: the join engine (exposed for *your* data)

* `standardize_country()`, `join_world()`, `attach_geometry()`, `country_join()`.

## New: diagnostics

* `check_country_match()`, `wdj_overrides()`, `audit_coverage()` — never lose a
  country silently.

## New: reference data & translation

* `convert_country()` (flags, currency, tld, research codes), `country_codes()`,
  `country_groups()` / `in_group()`, `wdi_search()`.
* Bundled datasets: `world_snapshot`, `country_meta`, `common_indicators`,
  `country_groups_tbl`, `world_tiles`.

## New: analysis helpers

* `per_capita()`, `aggregate_regions()`, `rank_countries()`, `complete_years()`.

## New: visualization

* `world_map()` (continuous / binned / quantile / jenks / categorical),
  `bubble_map()`, `bivariate_map()`, `cartogram_map()`, `tile_map()`,
  `flow_map()`, `animate_world()`, `interactive_map()`, `geom_country_labels()`,
  `theme_world_map()`.

## Performance & offline

* WDI fetches are memoised with an optional on-disk cache; multiple indicators
  are fetched in parallel (`parallel::mclapply`) where supported.
  See `clear_wdi_cache()`.
* The bundled `world_snapshot` lets every example, test and vignette run offline
  and deterministically.

## Engineering

* Namespace hygiene (targeted `@importFrom` instead of blanket `@import`).
* Input validation with friendly `cli` / `rlang` errors.
* A `testthat` (3e) suite; network calls are skipped offline and on CRAN.
* Vignettes and a `pkgdown` site.
* Refreshed CI: R-CMD-check, test-coverage and pkgdown workflows.
* Heavy spatial dependencies (`sf`, `rnaturalearth`, `cartogram`, `biscale`,
  `geofacet`, `gganimate`, `leaflet`, …) are all in `Suggests` and gated by
  `rlang::check_installed()`, so the base install stays light.

Group memberships in `country_groups_tbl` are point-in-time as of 2024-01-01.

# countryatlas 0.1.0

* Initial experimental release with a single `world_data(year)` function.
